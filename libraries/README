make_hypothetical.pl
  This just extracts hypothetical ORFs from a given gff file
  By itself, not very useful.

make_library.pl
  Extracts ORFs with some padding from the combination of a genomic
  fasta file and gff.   It has some initial attempts to figure out if
  the annotated transcripts are in the correct reading frame and/or if
  they contain a usable reading frame.  In its current form
  (01/01/2013) it isn't very useful other than as a reminder of quick
  and easy ways to extract sequences.

make_annotated_genes.pl
  This took make_library.pl and stripped the junk out and is useful
  for extracting all 'gene' annotations from the tritryp gff files.
  This script was used to perform various BLAST analyses of the
  T.cruzi haplotypes (described next).

concat_blast.sh
  Shell script to combine the Esmeraldo, Non-Esmeraldo, and unassigned
  haplotypes (and contigs) into the 7 possible combinations thereof.
  Each resulting blast database results in ${PWD}/blast and gets a
  shortened name 'esmer, non, unas, esmer-non ...'  These are then
  used by...

single-multi.pl
  Written with Wanderson.  Performs blast searches of each haplotype
  against the others to get a feeling for the single-copy ORFs, those
  with a couple/few, and many copies.
