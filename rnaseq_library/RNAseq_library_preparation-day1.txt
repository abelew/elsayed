This is a super-optimized protocol intended to allow anyone to
reproducibly prepare dsDNA libraries comprising from total mRNA.

The required starting material is 0.1-4ug mRNA.  Recommended to use
1-1.5ug.  The kit furthermore comes with controls for both end repair
steps, polyA tailing, and DNA ligase.

If using a new kit:  Get out the bead binding buffer, bead washing
buffer, elution buffer, elute-prime-fragment mix from the -20 and thaw
to RT.  Remove the RNA beads from 4C to RT, have the thermocycler
ready for program 01 and set the centrifuge to 20C.

  to beads.  Gently pipette mix 6x

  iiia.  Make sure the elution buffer is thawed for step III6.

II) Incubate RNA Binding Plate (Incubate 1 RBP)
  1.  Place sealed plate on the 01mRNADenaturation cycle (65C 5m, 4C)
    This denatures RNA and helps annealing.
  2.  Remove plate immediately when it hits 4C
  3.  Immediately remove seal from plate to avoid splashing
  4.  Let plate sit on bench 5min to allow RNA to bind beads

III) Wash RNA Binding Plate (Wash RBP)
  1.  Place plate on the magnetic stand RT 5 min to separate polyA RNA
  bound beads from solution
  2.  Remove and discards all supernatant from each well.  Do not
  distub the beads.
  3.  Remove from magnetic stand
  4.  Wash with 200ul bead washing buffer.  Pipette each well 6x.
  5.  Place back on stand 5 min RT.
  6.  Briefly centrifuge thawed elution buffer 600g 5 seconds.
  7.  Carefully remove supernatant again
  8.  Remove plate from stand.
  9.  Add 50ul Elution buffer and mix 6x
  10.  Add new seal and return elution buffer to 4C

IV)  Incubation I
  1.  Put plate on thermocycler set to 'RNA elution'
  2.  Remove immediately when it reaches 25C
  3.  Return plate to bench and carefully remove seal.

V) Make RNA Fragmentation Plate
  1.  Add 50ul bead binding buffer to each well, carefully mix 6x
  2.  Let sit RT 5 min, return binding buffer to 4C
  3.  Place on magnetic stand 5 min.
  4.  Remove all supernatant
  5.  Remove plate from stand.
  6.  Wash beads with 200ul bead washing buffer and mix 6x
  7.  Return buffer to 4C
  8.  Return plate to stand 5 min.
  9.  Carefully remove supernatant
  10. Remove from the stand
  11. Add 19.5 of EFP to each well, mix 6x
  12. Reseal plate
  13. Return EPF mix to -20C.
 
VI) Incubation II
  1.  Plate plate on thermocycler set to EFP
  2.  Remove immediately when thermocycler reaches 4C.

  via)  Get out a new plate with 'CDP' barcode

VII)  First Strand Synthesiss
  2.  Remove seal
  1.  Place plate on stand for 5 minutes, do not remove
  3.  Remove 17ul supernatant  to a new plate with 'CDP' barcode
  4.  Centrifuge first strand mix 600g 5seconds.
  5.  Assuming 6 samples, then make a master mix using: (thus 1:7
  enzyme to mix, add 8ul mix to make 25ul reaction)
    a) 49 ul first strand mix from superscript II box
    b) 7ul MMLV RT
  6.  Add 8ul of the first strand mix to each well of CDP plate and
  mix 6x
  7.  Reseal plate and "centrifuge" by hand

VIII)  cDNA incubation
  1.  Put plate on thermocycler with preprogrammed '1st strand
  synthesis'
  2.  Remove plate immediately when it reaches 4C

IX)  Second strand synthesis preparation
  1.  Remove 1 tube of 2nd strand master mix to RT
  2.  Bring AMPure XP beads to RT 30 minutes
  3.  Get thermocycler ready to go to 16C
  4.  Have the 'IMP' barcode on a new plate
  5.  Mix fresh 80% EtOH for washing steps

X)  Second strand synthesis
  2.  Remove seal.
  1.  briefly centrifuge 2nd strand 600g 5s
  3.  Add 25ul second strand mix to each well, mix 6x
  4.  Reseal plate
 
XI) Second strand incubation
  1.  Incubate plate 16C 1 hour
  2.  Remove plate, let sit until RT

XII) Second strand cleaning
  1.  Vortex AMPure XP beads, add 90ul beads to each well containing
  50ul cDNA, pipette mix 10x
  2.  Incubate plate 15 min RT
  3.  Place plate on magnetic stand for >= 5 min
  4.  Gently remove/discard 135ul supernatant from each well
  5.  Keep plate on stand.  Add 200ul 80% new ethanol gently.
  6.  Incubate plate 30 seconds RT, gently remove 80% etoh.
  5a. Keep plate on stand still.  Add 200ul 80% ethanol gently.
  6a.  Incubate plate 30 seconds RT, gently remove 80% EtOH.
