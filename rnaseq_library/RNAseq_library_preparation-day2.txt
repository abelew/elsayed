Day2 of the illumina super-optimized protocol for generating RNA seq
libraries.

Prep: 
  1.  Remove 1 tube of end repair mix
  2.  Thaw AMpure beads RT >= 30 min
  3.  Get fresh plate with 'ALP' barcode
  4.  Preheat thermocycler 30C

I) End Repair
  This process converts overhangs from fragmentation into blunt ends,
  using 3'->5' exonuclease activity while polymerase fills in 5'
  overhangs.

  1.  If using the end repair controls, make a 1:100 dilution in
  resuspension buffer.
  2.  Add 10ul of either diluted end repair or resuspension buffer
  directly to each dscDNA sample.
  3.  Add 40ul of end repair mix, gently mix 10x
  4.  Seal the plate

II) Incubate IMP (Insert modification plate)
  1.  30C 30 minutes on thermocycler
  2.  Remove plate

III) Clean ImP
  1.  Remove seal immediately
  2.  Vortex AMPure beads, add 160ul to each well.  Mix 10x
  3.  Incubate RT 15 min
  4.  Place on stand >= 5 minutes until clear
  5.  Remove/discard 127.5ul supernatant without disturbing beads
  6.  Repeat removal of beads, assuming ~ 5ul remain without
  disturbing beads
  7.  Gently add 200ul fresh 80% EtOH
  8.  Incubate >= 30 seconds on plate; remove/discard supernatant
  9.  Repeat 80% wash and discard
  10.  Leave samples on stand 15 minutes to dry.  Then remove.
  11.  Resuspend pellet 17.5ul resuspension buffer, pipette mix 10x
  gently
  12.  Incubate >= 2 minutes
  13.  Place back on stand >= 5 minutes
  14.  Transfer 15ul of supernatant to fresh 'ALP' plate

  This marks another safe stopping point perhaps the end of day 1.

III)  Adenylate 3' ends (Make Insert Modification Plate (A-tailing))

  Add a single 'A' to the 3' ends of the blunt fragments to prevent
  homo-ligation.  The adapters have a corresponding 'T' to promote
  adapter ligation.

  prep.  Thaw a-tailing mix RT
    preheat thermocycler 37C  

  1.  If using a-tailing control, make a 1:100 dilution in suspension
  buffer
  2.  Add 2.5ul of diluted control or resuspension buffer to each
  well.
  3.  Mix 30ul 10x
  4.  Add 12.5ul A-tailing mix to each well

IV)  Incubate A-tailing mix
  1.  Place plate on thermocycler 37C 30 minutes
  2.  Remove to RT

V)  Ligation
  prep:  Thaw chosen indices, stop-ligase mix, and optionally the
  ligase control, AMpure beads if not already
    Preheat the thermocycler 30C
    Get 2 new plates named 'CAP' and 'PCR'

  1.  Spin down indexed adapters and stop mix 600g 5 sec
  2.  Immediately before use, remove ligase mix (it is likely active
  at RT) and potentially aliquot this for future use...
  3.  Remove seal from plate
  4.  Add 2.5ul ligase mix to each well
  5.  Immediately return ligase to freezer
  6.  1:100 dilute ligation control if using
  7.  Add 2.5ul of ligation control or resuspension buffer to each
  well
  8.  Add 2.5ul of each thawed adapter
  9.  Mix the 40ul resulting reaction 10x gently
  10.  Seal plate

VI) Incubate Ligations
  1.  Incubate plate 30C 10 minutes
  2.  Remove plate to RT

VII) Stop Ligase
  1.  Remove seal
  2.  Add 5ul of stop ligase mix, pipette mix 10x

VIII) Clean Ligations
  1.  Vortex beads, add 42ul mixed beads to each well, mix 10x
  2.  Incubate plate RT 15 min
  3.  Incubate >= 5 min on stand until clear
  4.  Remove/discard 79.5ul supernatant while on stand
  5.  Add 200ul 80% EtOH gently
  6.  Let sit >= 30 seconds, remove/discard without disturbing
  7.  Repeat 200ul wash
  8.  15 minute dry on magnetic stand
  9.  Resuspend 52.5 resuspension buffer, mix 10x
  10.  Incubate RT 2 minutes
  11.  Place back on stand >= 5 minutes until clear
  12.  Transfer 50ul supernatant to 'CAP' plate  (Another cleaning)
  13.  Vortex beads Add 50ul to each well of the 'CAP' plate
  14.  Incubate RT 15 minutes
  15.  Place on stand >= 5 minutes until clear
  16.  Remove/discard 95ul supernatant gently
  17.  Perform 200ul 80% ethanol wash gently
  18.  Incubate >= 30 seconds on stand, remove supernatant
  19.  Repeat 80% wash
  20.  15 minute dry on stand
  21.  Resuspend pellet 22.5ul resuspension buffer with 10x gentle mix
  22.  Incubate >= 2 min RT
  23.  Place plate on stand >= 5 minutes until clear
  24.  Transfer 20ul supernatant to 'PCR' plate

IX)  PCR enrichment
  prep:  RT thaw PCR master mix and primer cocktail
    Thaw beads if necessary, prepare themocycler with 15 cycle 60C 30s
  anneal, 72C 30s extension, get new plate 'TSP1'
  1.  Add 5ul thawed primer cocktail to each well
  2.  Add 25ul master mix and mix all 40ul 10x gently
  3.  Seal plate

X)  Amplification
  1.  Run the program ;p

XI)  PCR cleaning
  1.  Vortex beads, add 50ul to each well -> 100ul total and mix 10x
  2.  Incubate RT 15 min
  3.  Place on stand >= 5 min until clear
  4.  Remove/discard 95ul
  5.  Add 200ul 80% EtOH
  6.  Incubate >= 30 seconds -> remove
  7.  Repeat 200ul wash
  8.  Let sit 15 min RT to dry
  9.  Resuspend 32.5 resuspension buffer with 10x mix
  10.  Incubate >= 2 min
  11.  Return to stand >= 5 min until clear
  12.  Move 30ul supernatant to 'TSP1' plate -- or perhaps to labeled
  eppendorf tubes, as at this point we can quantify the DNA and send
  it for bioanalyzer -> sequencing.
