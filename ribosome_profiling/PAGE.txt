Below is a checklist for performing RNA PAGE

*Note: my RNA loading dye is just formamide:bromophenol blue

1.  Pour 12-15% acrylamide gel (this recipe gives about 90 seconds to
 pour the gel before it sets.  Thus have pouring pipette and glasses
 ready before mixing.)
  a.  Clean plates before with RNAse-Zap
  b.  16.8 g Urea + 7-10 ml ideally heated water, heat.
  c.  4 ml 10x TBE
  d.  10-13 ml acrylamide mixture
  e.  18 ul TEMED
  f.  1 aliquot 10% APS (this is really excessive)
  g.  pour fast but carefully.
  h.  let sit ~ 3-5 minutes, optionally mix another 1-5 ml in case
   of severe leaks in the assembly box.
2.  Mix equal volumes of RNA / loading dye for each sample.
3.  Mix 10 ul each marker oligo with equal volume loading dye.
4.  Heat 65-95 C 2-5 minutes. (I don't like 95 for this)
5.  Ice chill 2-5 minutes.
6.  Load gel with markers + 20-100 bp ladder
  a.  I usually load them in reverse order so that when I crack the
   plates the gel falls and is handled reversed and therefore in
   'normal' order.  Also to avoid confusion I always load in this
   order:  1: ladder 2,3: markers 4-n: samples: n+1: 1-3 ul mRNA and
   leave the labeled eppendorf tubes with the samples in a rack until
   run completion for comparison.
7.  Run 3-5 hours <= 100 V.  The + electrode on the gel-box is
 uncertain, make sure the amperage stays 10<=n<=40 mA.  When the blue
 dye band is at/near the bottom it is finished.
8.  Add 10-15 ml 1x TBE to pyrex dish and add 1-3 ul 'BigRed' dye.
 This dye is much more sensitive than ethidium bromide and less
 dangerous, but is very UV and white-light sensitive.  Good staining
 can _NOT_ be seen if the lights are on.
9.  Open gel glasses over TBE/dye, dip cut plate into stain gel face
 down.
10. Usually the gel falls right in, if not, encourage it.
11. Let stain under cover 10 minutes rocking.
12. Pre-label 2ml eppendorfs _and_ 600 ul for each sample + marker.
13. Poke a hole in the 600 ul tubes with small syringe, place the
 small in the large tube in preparation for gel fragments.
12. Excise appropriate bands with a fresh blade.
13. Remove gel fragments to appropriately labeled 600/2000 tubes.
  a.  Some of the 2000 ul tubes explode in the centrifuge >= 7000
   rpm.  I have done this with the nice 1600 ul tubes and it seems fine.
14. Spin gel fragments into the larger tube >= 8000 rpm 2 minutes.
15. Add 400 ul RNA extraction buffer
16. Place in -80 for 30 minutes
17. Let sit RT overnight
18. Spin acrylamide+buffer through filter column into fresh
non-stick tube.
19. Purify samples using >17 nt process from zymo
 clean+concentrator.  If you can prove that RNA from a straight
 isopropanol/80% ethanol precipitation is sufficiently clean, then do
 that instead and move to #24.
20. Elute to 20-40 ul
21. Precipitate RNA with 1-2 ul glycogen and 100-200 ul isopropanol.
22. Spin RNA samples down >= 20 min, full speed, 4 C.
23. Wash pellet with 80% cold ethanol.
24. Let dry.
25. Resuspend 10 ul 10 mM Tris pH 8.


Below is a checklist for performing DNA PAGE.
This is basically the exact same as the RNA PAGE above.
However, I have found that the loading dyes for the DNA gels do not
work well and so I suggest adding a portion of the
formamide/bromophenol blue instead/along with the provided loading
dye.  In addition, one need not be so careful regarding RNAse
contamination (though since I use the same gel apparatus for DNA and
RNA, it is better to be careful).

A note on the ladders:  in my hands at least the NEB small DNA dye
(N0474G) is a terrible failure, its loading dye leaps out of the wells
every time.  Instead I had better success with the Fermentas
O'RangeRuler 20bp DNA ladder.  In either instance, however, I think
it is worth while to add an aliquot of straight formamide+blue.

1.  Pour 12-15% acrylamide gel (this recipe gives about 90 seconds to
 pour the gel before it sets.  Thus have pouring pipette and glasses
 ready before mixing.)
  a.  Clean plates before with RNAse-Zap
  b.  16.8 g Urea + 7-10 ml ideally heated water, heat.
  c.  4 ml 10x TBE
  d.  10-13 ml acrylamide mixture
  e.  18 ul TEMED
  f.  1 aliquot 10% APS (this is really excessive)
  g.  pour fast but carefully.
  h.  let sit ~ 3-5 minutes, optionally mix another 1-5 ml in case
   of severe leaks in the assembly box.
2.  Mix equal volumes of DNA / blue:formamide loading dye for each sample.
3.  Mix an aliquot of ladder + water to 20ul, then add an equal volume blue:formamide
4.  Heat 65-95 C 2-5 minutes. (I don't like 95 for this)
5.  Ice chill 1 minute
6.  Load gel with samples and ladder on both sides.
  a.  I usually load them in reverse order
7.  Run 1-5 hours >= 100 V.  This may theoretically be run up to
 1600V.
8.  Add 10-15 ml 1x TBE to pyrex dish and add 1-3 ul 'BigRed' dye.
9.  Open gel glasses over TBE/dye, dip cut plate into stain gel face
 down.
10. Usually the gel falls right in, if not, encourage it.
11. Let stain under cover 10 minutes rocking.
12. Pre-label 2ml eppendorfs _and_ 600 ul for each sample + marker.
13. Poke a hole in the 600 ul tubes with small syringe, place the
 small in the large tube in preparation for gel fragments.
12. Excise appropriate bands.
13. Remove gel fragments to appropriately labeled 600/1700 ul tubes.
14. Spin gel fragments into the larger tube >= 8000 rpm 2 minutes.
15. Add 400 ul DNA extraction buffer
16. Place in -80 for 30 minutes
17. Let sit RT overnight
18. Spin acrylamide+buffer through filter column into fresh
non-stick tube.
19. Elute to 20-40 ul
20. Precipitate RNA with 1-2 ul glycogen and 100-200 ul isopropanol.
21. Spin RNA samples down >= 20 min, full speed, 4 C.
22. Wash pellet with 80% cold ethanol.
23. Let dry.
24. Resuspend 10 ul 10 mM Tris pH 8.
