This describes the process to polyA select from totalRNA and integrate
it into the existing ribosome profiling library protocol.

This begins with the total RNA isolated at step II 9 of the ribosome
profiling protocol and uses the excess oligo dT magnetic beads
provided by the illumina RNAseq kit.  It therefore follows that
protocol precisely until the 'elute-fragment-prime' step -- at this
point it deviates because the illumina protocol uses random hexamers.
I instead choose to do a 95C incubation with 1x PNK buffer for 10
minutes.  This is very similar to the Epicentre 'ARTseq' process --
their buffer is 330 mM Tris-Acetate pH 7.5; 660 mM potassium acetate;
100 mM MgCl2; 5 mM DTT while the default NEB PNK buffer is 700 mM
Tris-HCl; 100 mM MgCl2; 50 mM DTT.  Since (I presume) this is a
magnesium based fragmentation, either buffer should be equally usable
(both have same magnesium)

Thus, starting with 200 ul total RNA.

I)  RNA Binding to Beads
  1.  Thaw beads and vortex
  2.  Take 50 ul total RNA to PCR plate
  3.  Add 50 ul RNA purification beads, pipette 6x to mix
  4.  Place on thermocycler using the 'mRNA denaturation' cycle (65C 5
  min, 4 C forever)
  5.  Remove when thermocycler reaches 4C
  6.  Place on bench 5 minutes to help bead binding.
  7.  Place on magnetic stand 5 minutes to separate polyA
  8.  Remove supernatant

II)  Wash RNA and Beads
  1.  Remove plate from stand
  2.  Remove supernatant, do not distub beads
  3.  Wash with 200 ul Bead Washing Buffer, mix 6x
  4.  Place back on stand 5 minutes RT
  5.  Remove/discard supernatant while on plate
  6.  Remove from magnetic stand
  7.  Add 50 ul Elution Buffer, mix 6x

III) RNA Elution
  1.  Place plate on thermocycler with the mRNA Elution program (80C 2
  min, 25C forever) -- this elutes both mRNA and any remaining
  ribosomal contamination
  2.  Remove plate from thermocycler when it reaches 25C
  3.  Return to bench

IV) Prepare Fragmentation
  At this point have a PCR plate with beads + eluted RNA
  1.  Add 50 ul Bead Binding Buffer, mix 6x  -- mRNA should rebind to
  beads
  2.  Incubate plate RT 5 minutes (return bead binding buffer)
  3.  Place plate on magnetic stand 5 minutes
  4.  Remove/discard all supernatant
  5.  Remove from stand
  6.  Wash beads with 200 ul bead washing buffer, mix 6x (return
  washing buffer to fridge)
  7.  Place plate back on stand 5 minutes
  8.  Remove/discard supernatant
  9.  Remove from stand

V) Fragmentation
  1.  Add 45 ul Elution buffer and 5 ul NEB 10x PNK buffer
  2.  Place on thermocycler on Fragmentation cycle (94C 8 minutes)
  3.  Place plate on magnetic rack 5 minutes
  4.  Remove supernatant away from beads, remaining RNA should be
  fragmented and ready for PNK reaction

  Note after discussion with Wanderson:
  At this point I think it is important to gel purify the RNA to 28-50 nt fragments.
  This would be as per step VII in the ribosome profile protocol.
  Purifying the RNA before PNK at this point has one big advantage:
  Post PNK and ligation, one must run another PAGE to see its state
  and purify away from adaptor.  Thus if the 30-50 nt fragmented polyA
  RNAs are gel purified at this time, then a successful ligation
  downstream will be easily seen as ~80-110 fragments.  Unincorporated
  primers therefore at ~50.

  On the other hand, if size selection is not performed, continue:

  5.  Add 1 ul NEB PNK enzyme
  6.  Incubate 37C 1 hour for end repair
  7.  Precipitate with 39 ul water, 1 ul glycoblue, 10 ul 3M NaOAc,
  150 ul isopropanol

  At this point, the RNA should be in the exact state as in the
  ribosome profile purified fragments on step IX "Linker Ligation"
