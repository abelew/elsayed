Going to attempt to make a checklist-esque protocol as per
RNAseq_library_preparation.

I) Lysis Buffer Preparation
  1.  For each 1 ml lysis buffer desired, mix:
      a)  1 ml polysome buffer*
      b)  50 ul 10% Triton-X
      c)  24 U DNAse
      d)  10 ul [0.1 M] DTT
      e)  100 ug cycloheximide  (2 ul of 50 ug/ul stock)
  2.  For each 10 ml of cell culture, make 2-5 ml 1x PBS
      a)  Supplement with 8-20 ul cycloheximide for each 10 ml final
      volume.
  3.  For each 40 ml of cell culture, mix 10 ml growth media
  supplemented with cycloheximide (100 ul cycloheximide for each 40 ml
  media)

II) Cell Lysis (A)
  1.  Add cycloheximide/growth media to cells.  Let sit 3-5 min.
  2.  Split cells/cycloheximide to an even number of 50ml conical tubes.
  3.  Spin down 4 min @ >= 3k rpm.
  4.  Replace media with PBS
  5.  Spin down 4 min @ >= 3k rpm.
  6.  Replace PBS/cycloheximide with 1 ml lysis buffer / conical.
  7.  Mix lyse >= 20x with the 1000 ul pipettor.
  8.  Spin down maximum speed 10 min 4C.
  9.  Remove 200 ul to RNA collection eppendorf (B).
  10. Remove rest (800 ul) to RP collection eppendorf (C).

III) Ribosome Profile Digestion (C)
  1.  To calibrate amount of RNAseI added to lysate, place 1 ul 1:10
  diluted on nanodrop.  For each 5 OD recorded in this fashion, use
  120 U RNAseI.  This seems to work out to ~ 8 ul RNAseI (at 100 U /
  ul) for each 300 ul lysate.
  2.  Take 300 ul of lysate, add appropriate amount of RNAseI.
  3.  Mix 45 min RT.
  4.  Freeze remaining lysate -80 C.

IV) Total mRNA Isolation (B)
  1.  Add 1:10 volume 10% SDS and equal volume Acid Phenol:Chloroform
  to the remaining total mRNA.
  2.  Mix / vortex samples
  3.  Spin down maximum speed ~ 5 min 4 C.
  4.  Depending on sample concentration, repeat up to 2x.
  5.  Finish with final isolation of Chloroform:IAA (24:1)
  6.  Precipitate with 2 ul glycogen, 1:10 volume NaOAc, 1.5 volume
  Isopropanol.  Store -20 C >= 2 hours.
    Potentially much later...
  7.  Spin RNA samples down >= 20 min, full speed, 4 C.
  8.  Wash pellet with 80% cold ethanol.
  9.  Let dry.
  10. Resuspend 25 ul water and record concentration.

V) Ribosome Fragment isolation with S400 column
  Note:  Sephacryl columns come with TE, which will dissociate
  ribosomes.
  1.  Re-equilibrate column with >= 3 ml polysome buffer with
  cycloheximide.
     a.  This is performed by evacuating the column repeatedly with
  buffer.
  2.  When digestion from "III" is complete, add 15 ul SUPERaseIn to
  samples.
  3.  Centrifuge through S400 column 600 g 2 minutes.
  4.  Collect flowthrough and add 100 ul polysome buffer and 20 ul 10%
  SDS.
  5.  Extract RNA as per IV.

VI) rRNA removal
  1.  Not yet performed.

VII)  PAGE purification of 28-30 nt fragments
  *Note: my RNA loading dye is just formamide:bromophenol blue
  1.  Pour 12-15% acrylamide gel (this recipe gives about 90 seconds to
  pour the gel before it sets.  Thus have pouring pipette and glasses
  ready before mixing.)
    a.  Clean plates before with RNAse-Zap
    b.  16.8 g Urea + 7-10 ml ideally heated water, heat.
    c.  4 ml 10x TBE
    d.  10-13 ml acrylamide mixture
    e.  18 ul TEMED
    f.  1 aliquot 10% APS (this is really excessive)
    g.  pour fast but carefully.
    h.  let sit ~ 3-5 minutes, optionally mix another 1-5 ml in case
    of severe leaks in our terribad pouring box.
  2.  Mix equal volumes of RNA / loading dye for each sample.
  3.  Mix 10 ul each marker oligo with equal volume loading dye.
  4.  Heat 65-95 C 2-5 minutes. (I don't like 95 for this)
  5.  Ice chill 2-5 minutes.
  6.  Load gel with markers + 20-100 bp ladder
    a.  I usually load them in reverse order so that when I crack the
    plates the gel falls and is handled reversed and therefore in
    'normal' order.  Also to avoid confusion I always load in this
    order:  1: ladder 2,3: markers 4-n: samples: n+1: 1-3 ul mRNA and
    leave the labeled eppendorf tubes with the samples in a rack until
    run completion for comparison.
  7.  Run 3-5 hours <= 100 V.  The + electrode on the gel-box is
  uncertain, make sure the amperage stays 10<=n<=40 mA.  When the blue
  dye band is at/near the bottom it is finished.
  8.  Add 10-15 ml 1x TBE to pyrex dish and add 1-3 ul 'BigRed' dye.
  This dye is much more sensitive than ethidium bromide and less
  dangerous, but is very UV and white-light sensitive.  Good staining
  can _NOT_ be seen if the lights are on.
  9.  Open gel glasses over TBE/dye, dip cut plate into stain gel face
  down.
  10. Usually the gel falls right in, if not, encourage it.
  11. Let stain under cover 10 minutes rocking.
  12. Pre-label 2ml eppendorfs _and_ 600 ul for each sample + marker.
  13. Poke a hole in the 600 ul tubes with small syringe, place the
  small in the large tube in preparation for gel fragments.
  12. Excise 26-34 bp bands and 1 oligo marker with fresh blade.
  13. Remove gel fragments to appropriately labeled 600/2000 tubes.
      a.  Some of the 2000 ul tubes explode in the centrifuge >= 7000
      rpm.  I have done this with the nice 1600 ul tubes and it seems fine.
  14. Spin gel fragments into the larger tube >= 8000 rpm 2 minutes.
  15. Add 400 ul water, 40 ul 3M NaOAc, 40 ul, 4ul 0.1M EDTA, >= 2 ul
  10% SDS  (Hey make a stock of this)
  16. Place -80 C 30 minutes
  17. Let sit RT overnight
  18. Spin acrylamide+buffer through filter column into fresh
  non-stick tube.
  19. Purify samples using >17 nt process from zymo
  clean+concentrator.

  22. Spin RNA samples down >= 20 min, full speed, 4 C.
  23. Wash pellet with 80% cold ethanol.
  24. Let dry.
  25. Resuspend 10 ul 10 mM Tris pH 8.

  6.  Incubate 1 hour 37 C.
  7.  Heat inactivate 70 C 10 min.
  8.  Precipitate with 39 ul water, 1 ul glycogen, 10 ul 3 M NaOAc,
  150 ul isopropanol.
  9.  Incubate >= 2 hours -20 C.
  10. Spin down max speed >= 20 min 4 C.
  11. Air dry sideways >= 15 minutes.

IX)  Linker Ligation
  1.  Resuspend RNA 8.5 ul 10 mM Tris pH 8 in a fresh tube.
  2.  Add 1.5 ul preadenylated linker (0.5 ug / ul)
  3.  Denature 90 seconds 80 C, cool to RT.
  4.  Add 2 ul T4 Rnl2 buffer
  5.  Add 6 ul PEG 8000 (50%)
