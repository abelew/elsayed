Going to attempt to make a checklist-esque protocol as per
RNAseq_library_preparation.

I) Lysis Buffer Preparation
  1.  For each 1 ml lysis buffer desired, mix:
      a)  1 ml polysome buffer*
      b)  50 ul 10% Triton-X
      c)  24 U DNAse
      d)  10 ul [0.1 M] DTT
      e)  100 ug cycloheximide  (2 ul of 50 ug/ul stock)
  2.  For each 10 ml of cell culture, make 2-5 ml 1x PBS
      a)  Supplement with 8-20 ul cycloheximide for each 10 ml final
      volume.
  3.  For each 40 ml of cell culture, mix 10 ml growth media
  supplemented with cycloheximide (100 ul cycloheximide for each 40 ml
  media)

II) Cell Lysis (A)
  1.  Add cycloheximide/growth media to cells.  Let sit 3-5 min.
  2.  Split cells/cycloheximide to an even number of 50ml conical tubes.
  3.  Spin down 4 min @ >= 3k rpm.
  4.  Replace media with PBS
  5.  Spin down 4 min @ >= 3k rpm.
  6.  Replace PBS/cycloheximide with 1 ml lysis buffer / conical.
  7.  Mix lyse >= 20x with the 1000 ul pipettor.
  8.  Spin down maximum speed 10 min 4C.
  9.  Remove 200 ul to RNA collection eppendorf (B).
  10. Remove rest (800 ul) to RP collection eppendorf (C).

III) Ribosome Profile Digestion (C)
  1.  To calibrate amount of RNAseI added to lysate, place 1 ul 1:10
  diluted on nanodrop.  For each 5 OD recorded in this fashion, use
  120 U RNAseI.  This seems to work out to ~ 8 ul RNAseI (at 100 U /
  ul) for each 300 ul lysate.
  2.  Take 300 ul of lysate, add appropriate amount of RNAseI.
  3.  Mix 45 min RT.
  4.  Freeze remaining lysate -80 C.

IV) Total mRNA Isolation (B)
  1.  Add 1:10 volume 10% SDS and equal volume Acid Phenol:Chloroform
  to the remaining total mRNA.
  2.  Mix / vortex samples
  3.  Spin down maximum speed ~ 5 min 4 C.
  4.  Depending on sample concentration, repeat up to 2x.
  5.  Finish with final isolation of Chloroform:IAA (24:1)
  6.  Precipitate with 2 ul glycogen, 1:10 volume NaOAc, 1.5 volume
  Isopropanol.  Store -20 C >= 2 hours.
    Potentially much later...
  7.  Spin RNA samples down >= 20 min, full speed, 4 C.
  8.  Wash pellet with 80% cold ethanol.
  9.  Let dry.
  10. Resuspend 25 ul water and record concentration.

V) Ribosome Fragment isolation with S400 column
  Note:  Sephacryl columns come with TE, which will dissociate
  ribosomes.
  1.  Re-equilibrate column with >= 3 ml polysome buffer with
  cycloheximide.
     a.  This is performed by evacuating the column repeatedly with
  buffer.
  2.  When digestion from "III" is complete, add 15 ul SUPERaseIn to
  samples.
  3.  Centrifuge through S400 column 600 g 2 minutes.
  4.  Collect flowthrough and add 100 ul polysome buffer and 20 ul 10%
  SDS.
  5.  Extract RNA as per IV.

Day 1 likely ends here with both the ribosome protected fragments and
total mRNA ethanol precipitating.

VII)  PAGE purification of 28-30 nt fragments
  Perform PAGE as described in 'PAGE.txt'

Depending on timing, Day 2 or Day 3 begins with isopropanol
precipitating 30 nt fragments from PAGE purification.  These will need
to be washed as per PAGE.txt with (hopefully optional) Zymo cleaning
and concentration.  The resulting blue RNA pellet should be eluted in
10ul Tris pH8 in a fresh tube labaled for dephosphorylation.
  
VIII)  Dephosphorylate RNA fragments
  1.  Add 33 ul water to samples
  2.  Denature 80 C 90 seconds.
  3.  Add 5 ul 10x PNK buffer
  4.  Add 1 ul SuperaseIn
  5.  Add 1 ul T4 PNK
  6.  Incubate 1 hour 37 C.
  7.  Heat inactivate 70 C 10 min.
  8.  Precipitate with 39 ul water, 1 ul glycogen, 10 ul 3 M NaOAc,
  150 ul isopropanol.
  9.  Incubate >= 2 hours -20 C.
  10. Spin down max speed >= 20 min 4 C.
  11. Air dry sideways >= 15 minutes.

IX)  Linker Ligation
  1.  Resuspend RNA 8.5 ul 10 mM Tris pH 8 in a fresh tube.
  2.  Add 1.5 ul preadenylated linker (0.5 ug / ul)
  3.  Denature 90 seconds 80 C, cool to RT.

  5.  Add 6 ul PEG 8000 (50%)
  6.  Add 1 ul superaseIn
  7.  Add 1 ul T4 Rnl2(tr)
  8.  Incubate 2.5 hours RT
  9.  Add 340 ul water, 40 ul NaOAc, 1-2 ul glycogen
  10. Add 500 ul isopropanol.
  11. Incubate >= 2 hours -20 C.
  12. Spin down max speed >= 20 min 4 C.
  13. Air dry sideways >= 15 minutes.

X)  Ligation product Gel separation
 Perform PAGE as described in 'PAGE.txt'
 It is possible to add another aliquot of the original 30bp marker
 oligo at this point for an additional size marker.

Day 3-4 likely ends with the ligated RNA samples spinning on the red
rotoflex overnight in acrylamide.
Day 4-5 thus begins with isopropanol precipitation of the ligated RNA
fragments.  These will need to be washed as per PAGE.txt with
(hopefully optional) Zymo cleaning and concentration.  The resulting
blue RNA pellet should be eluted in 10ul Tris pH8 in a fresh tube
labaled for reverse transcription.

XI) Reverse Transcription (Super Script III)
  1.  Add 2 ul RT primer (from 1.25 uM stock)
  2.  Denature 80 C 90 seconds.
  3.  Return thermocycler 48 C.
  4.  Add 4 ul 1st strand buffer 
  5.  Add 1 ul 10 mM dNTPs
  6.  Add 1 ul 0.1 M DTT
  7.  Add 1 ul SuperaseIn
  8.  Add 1 ul superscript III
  9.  Incubate on thermocycler 48 C 30 minutes.
  10. Destroy RNA with 2.2 ul 1 N NaOH to each reaction.
  11. Incubate 95 C 20 min.
  12. Add 20 ul 3 M NaOAc, 2 ul glycogen, 156 ul water.
  13. Add 300 ul isopropanol.
  14. Incubate >= 2 hours -20 C.
  15. Spin down max speed >= 20 min 4 C.
  16. Air dry sideways >= 15 minutes.

XII) PAGE purification of cDNA products
 Perform PAGE as described in 'PAGE.txt'  Note that there are a few
 minor differences for DNA samples.  
 It is advised to add an aliquot of the RT primer to one well, as it
 runs surprisingly large.

Day 5-6 therefore ends with the ssDNA fragments in extraction buffer
on the rotoflex.  Similarly 6-7 begins with cleaning the ssDNA and
getting it ready for circularization.

XIII) cDNA circularization
  1.  To each reaction, add 2ul circular-ligase buffer
  2.  1 ul ATP
  3.  1 ul MnCl2
  4.  1 ul Circularligase
  5.  Incubate 1 hour 60 C
  6.  Heat inactivate 80 C 10 min.

XIV) rRNA depletion
  1.  Combine 5 ul circularization reaction with 1 ul oligo
  subtraction pool in PCR tube.
  2.  Add 1 ul 20x SSC
  3.  Add 3 ul water
  4.  Denature 90 seconds 100 C.
  5.  Anneal by decreasing to 37 C in 0.1 C / second increments,
  followed by 15 min 37 C incubation.
  6.  Vortex Streptavidin C1 DynaBeads (10 mg / ml) to resuspend.
  7.  Add 37.5 ul beads for each subtraction aliquot.
  8.  Transfer beads to fresh eppendorf and place on magnetic rack 1
  minute.
  9.  Remove all liquid
  10. Remove tube from rack and resuspend in 37.5 ul 1x wash/bind
  buffer
  11. Repeat binding, isolation, rinsing process
  12. Repeat binding, isolation, rinsing process
  13. Repeat binding, place beads on rack, withdraw eluent, resuspend
  in 10 ul of 2x bind/wash buffer.
  14. Transfer 10.0 μl of subtraction reaction directly from the PCR
  tube in the thermal cycler (from Step 46) to a bead aliquot
  in the ThermoMixer. Incubate for 15 min at 37 °C with mixing at 1,000
  rpm. 
  15. Transfer tubes directly from the ThermoMixer to a magnetic rack
  and isolate beads for 1 min. Recover 17.5 ul of eluate from the
  depletion and transfer it to a new nonstick Microfuge tube.
  16. Isopropanol precipitate as above.
  17. Resuspend 5 ul 10 mM Tris pH 8.

XV) PCR amplification and barcode addition
  1.  Make 100 ul PCR reaction mixes for each sample
    a) 20 ul Phusion HF buffer
    b) 2 ul 10 mM dNTP
    c) 0.5 ul 100 mM Forward library primer
    d) 0.5 ul 100 mM Reverse library primer
    e) 5 ul circularized template
    f) 71 ul water
    g) 1 ul polymerase
  2.  Split reaction into 5 16.7 ul PCR tubes
  3.  Perform PCR with 6,8,10,12,14 cycles of 10s denature, 10s 65 C
  annealing, 5s 72 extension.

XVI)  PAGE purification of libraries
 Perform PAGE as described in 'PAGE.txt'  Note that there are a few
 minor differences for DNA samples.  
 It may be a good idea to run the RT oligo here as well.  The good PCR
 product should be larger than both the unincorporated forward/reverse
 oligos and the large spacer oligo.  The ideal running size for these
 fragments is 175bp.

Day 6-7 therefore ends with the dsDNA PCR products on the rotoflex.
The following day will clean it and submission for bioanlyzer.
